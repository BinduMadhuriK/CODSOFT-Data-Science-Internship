# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
- Developed a predictive model to determine survival likelihood on the Titanic dataset.
- Utilized several classification models to predict survival
- Implemented the project using Python with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Seaborn for analysis and model development.

## Project Details
- Objective: Predict survival probability of passengers aboard the Titanic.
- Model Used: 'LogisticRegression,'DecisionTree','RandomForest','Bagging','Adaboost', 'Gradient Boosting', 'XGBoost','Support Vector Machine','K-Nearest Neighbors',  'Naive Bayes Gaussian' and 'Naive Bayes Bernoullies' from Scikit-learn along with 'Voting Classifier' for the best prediction model.
- Best Model: Support Vector Machine Model
- Accuracy Achieved: 98%.

## Key Features
- Conducted data preprocessing including handling missing values and feature engineering.
- Used Standarization technique to normalise the data before model training.
- Trained several classification models to predict survival, most of which performed well, likely due to the relatively small dataset size. Out of which, SVM model gave 98% accuracy and KNN model gave 96.4% accuracy
- Model evaluation involved accuracy measurement and potentially other relevant metrics.
