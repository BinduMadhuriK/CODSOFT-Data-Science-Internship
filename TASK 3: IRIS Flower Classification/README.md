# TASK 3: IRIS Flower Classification

## Overview
- This data science project focuses on classifying the Iris flower species using machine learning models.
- It includes importing necessary libraries, data inspection, data visualization, model building, generating predictions, and evaluating model performance.
- The primary goal of this multiclassification project is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model capable of predicting the species type of an Iris flower based on its morphological features.
- The purpose of this project is to employ the required machine learning techniques to improve our comprehension of the morphological variations present within the Iris species.
- This information can be valuable for various stakeholders, including botanists, researchers, and horticulturists, as it enhances our ability to categorize and interpret the diversity present in Iris flowers.

## Key Insights
- The dataset is balanced i.e. equal records are present for all three species.
- We have four numerical columns while just one categorical column which in turn is our target column.
- We have performed Explorative Data Analysis on the Iris dataset and created various colorful visualizations, including boxplots, pairplots, histogram, histogram with a density plot, swarm Plots, violin plots, a correlation heatmap, and a pie chart for species distribution.
- These visualizations helped in understanding the relationships and differences between Iris species and features, making it easier to classify and analyze these flowers based on their measurements.
- The setosa species is the most easily distinguishable because of its small feature size. The Versicolor and Virginica species are usually mixed and are sometimes hard to separate, while usually Versicolor has average feature sizes and virginica has larger feature sizes.
- EDA with visualizations of the Iris dataset reveals that features like petal length and petal width are highly discriminative for distinguishing between the three Iris species. This information is crucial to build a machine learning model for Iris species classification.
- By employing machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification, Gaussian Naive Bayes classification, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, we successfully constructed models capable of precisely classifying Iris flowers into their respective species based on these measurements.
- Furthermore, the evaluation of machine learning models revealed that K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) outperformed other classification models, with an impressive accuracy of 97% on unseen data, highlighting the model's robustness.
- Our results highlight the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in automating species classification based on morphological attributes, contributing to the fields of botany, ecology, and beyond.
